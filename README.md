# PredatorChase

This is programs is suposed to simulate a predator chasing its prey. There are three diffrent classes:
1) Wolves,which are trying to hunt both the deer and the rabbits
2) Deer, which want to avoid the wolves but catch the rabbits
3) Rabbits, which want to avoid both the deer and the wolves

A final version of this project would smooth out the avoidence method and add more variables to better imporve the simulation.
